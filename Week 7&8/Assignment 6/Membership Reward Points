//A business wants to record the reward points a client earns per month. 
//The reward points are based on the type of membership the client has and how much the client purchased for the month. 
//The program has to be written to include a separate function for each membership the client has. 
//Display the reward points as integers.

//The following table shows the types of membership, total monthly purchase
//and the reward points.

//Individual Membership >> 0-100 and 101 & over purchase per month >>  15% and 20% of total Monthly purchase
//Family Membership >> 0-100 and 101 & over purchase per month >>  20% and 25% of total Monthly purchase
//Individual Membership >> 0-100 and 101 & over purchase per month >>  25% and 30% of total Monthly purchase
